## Search Box in HTML & CSS with Icon

This is a pretty nice, elegant and neat animated search box.

I practiced here gradients, a lot of shadows cool compositions and also practiced adding ion icons.

Pretty simple HTML and CSS Only.

This was taken from the Online Tutorials [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIt719I-p-o&t=14s)

Amazing HTML(SVG) and CSS ONLY!!
